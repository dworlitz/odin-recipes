<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which keeps the meat nice and moist;</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Sauces: </strong> You'll need Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is optional, but it's a great addition for people who appreciate a little heat;</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Lemon juice:</strong> The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other flavors, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the meat even further;</li> 
        <br>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This flavorful marinade is seasoned with dried basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced garlic. </li>
        </ul>
</p>

<h3>How to cook</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Season steaks generously on both sides with salt. Allow steaks to come to room temperature while you make the sauce;</li>

        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Stir together demi-glace (see Cook's Note), mustard, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, and cayenne pepper in a bowl;</li>

        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Heat oil in a skillet over very high heat, swirling carefully to evenly cover surface. When oil reaches a smoking point, transfer steaks to oil; add a few chunks of butter;</li>

        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Sear meat on high heat until brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side; keep them on the rare side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a warm plate;</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Stir shallots into skillet; cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; pour in Cognac. Carefully ignite with a fireplace lighter. When alcohol burns off and flames go out, return skillet to high heat and bring to a boil; cook, stirring, a few minutes to reduce slightly;</li>

        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Add demi-glace mixture, cream, and any accumulated juices from the steak. Cook on high heat just until sauce starts to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer steaks back to pan and reduce heat to low. Gently simmer until meat is heated through and cooked to your desired level of doneness;</li>

        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Transfer to hot plates and serve with a generous spoonful or two of sauce. Sprinkle with chives;</li>
       
    </ol>
